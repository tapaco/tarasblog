Roots in Ukrine, born in London, bred in Buckinghamshire.

After studying Economics and Econometrics at University of Bristol, I'm now supporting startups in their cloud journeys at Amazon Web Services. 

Sport has always been my lifeblood - from getting stuck in to martial arts from the age of eight to now running long distance. I'm also keen to share the benefits it brings to others who are at a disadvantage, having coached tennis to children on the autism spectrum. I actively follow athletics, basketball, boxing, tennis and most importantly, religiously follow my local football club Wycombe Wanderers FC. 

More recently, I've been developing my coding skills and spend my free time applying them to all things sport.
